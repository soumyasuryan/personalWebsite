    <h4 className="mb-5 w-[80%] mx-auto">I am an enthusiastic learner with a strong passion for exploring new technologies while continuously mastering existing ones. My journey began with programming, which naturally led me into web development. To build intelligent systems and analyze data effectively, I expanded my skill set into AI and Machine Learning. To complete the development lifecycle, I further explored cloud technologies for deployment.</h4>
    <h4 className="w-[80%] mx-auto">What drives me forward is a persistent spark of curiosity and resilience. Setbacks don’t hold me back—instead, they push me to adapt, improve, and move forward with greater clarity. This mindset gives me a clear vision and the determination to see every task through to completion.</h4>
